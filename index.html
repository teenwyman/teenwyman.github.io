    <h2>About Teen</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">
    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">NDORMS</a> as a database programmer in September 2022. I am working on mapping the <a href="https://cprd.com/" target="_blank">CPRD</a> data to the <a href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/index.html" target="_blank">OMOP Common Data Model</a>.</p>
    <p>My interests include programming and health tech. Before my current position, I worked as an analyst programmer in public and private healthcare sectors in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Working with a wide range of stakeholders of the <a href="https://www.ehealth.gov.hk/en/index.html" target="_blank">Electronic Health Record Sharing System</a>, I assisted in web application development, automated testing implementation, troubleshooting, data analysis, and service enhancement, particularly in drug and immunisation domains. I participated in a clinical management system revamp project for a private hospital, including migrating large-scale medical records and designing and implementing billing and pharmacy dispensing systems.</p>
    <p>I completed a Master's degree in Healthcare Operational Management at the University of Warwick and a BSc in Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong. I have expertise in problem-solving, software development, and health informatics.</p>
    <p>My working experience includes healthcare system building, testing, implementation and integration, quality improvement, and project management.</p>
